App Overview
------------
This sample IoT app illustrates how to read digital data using the touch sensor
in a Grover Starter Kit Plus – IoT Intel® Edition. Also, this application will
start a simple web server on the IoT board that can be used to communicate
wirelessly with the board, using a WebSocket connection.

This sample has been tested on an [Intel® Galileo Board](http://intel.com/galileo)
and an [Intel® Edison Development Platform](http://intel.com/edison). It may run on
other IoT [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) development platforms, but may require
changes to the I/O initialization and configuration code to work on other platforms.
